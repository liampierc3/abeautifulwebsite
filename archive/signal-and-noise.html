                <p>The signal was a concept I've always understood at a more subconscious level. Rick Rubin was the first person I heard verbalize it. He describes it as humans being something creativity flows through vs creating ideas themselves. Those who have a good antenna can access the signal of good ideas and utilize them.</p>

                <p>Many think ideas are sort of magical and come at obscure times, but as far as I'm concerned that may be a misconception. A good idea comes at a time when you have little "noise" or interference - your mind is calm or relaxed, you're present and not thinking of the past or future, you're not distracted by literal noise or media.</p>

                <p>Not doing anything is a great way to access this "signal," however most can't calm their minds enough at will. If you've ever had a shower thought, that was no accident. You gave your mind 10 minutes to wander freely wherever it wanted to go. You can do this whenever you want.</p>

                <h3>The Art of Doing Nothing</h3>

                <p>Meditation is a misunderstood activity. What I just described as letting your mind wander freely is basically meditation. You don't have to sit with your eyes closed in a funny posture. It's the art of doing nothing, and how often do we give ourselves a few minutes to do nothing? Not often. It's counterintuitive to our conditioning.</p>

                <p>My thesis is that ideas come to a mind which is calm and at peace. Our lives become so distracted as we get older that we can't imagine a life without noise - literal noise, media, the news, distractions, reality TV.</p>

                <p>Type A people who run around distracted are the epitome of noise. They're not only distracting themselves by bringing in more noise, they're also creating it. They're blocking themselves from clear thought through endless distractions that they refer to as discipline and work ethic. It's not a right or wrong approach to life, but I do believe it limits access to good ideas.</p>

                <p>If you would like to, you can be an idea factory of sorts if you cultivate and create a calm mind.</p>

                <h3>Ideas as Raw Materials</h3>

                <p>Ideas are like raw materials to a factory. The materials come from elsewhere. Then the factory transforms the materials into a final product using tools and machines. The factory doesn't make the material itself - it uses creativity to transform it into something new. Do you see the parallels to ideas? They both come from elsewhere and you use your brain as a tool to bring them to life. Ideas are like an organism that wants to come to life. It uses our minds as a vehicle to do so.</p>

                <p>Until recently I thought signal to be limited to more artistic endeavors. I've since realized it to be a phenomenon that exists everywhere. After reading all of Nassim Taleb's books, I encountered his ideas on signal and noise relating to the stock market and life itself. He believes humans have a tendency to be drowning in noise at all times, limiting our ability to make clear decisions.</p>

                <h3>The Taleb Approach</h3>

                <p>Much of Taleb's life isn't spent working extremely hard. It might be the opposite. He spends his time cultivating a calm mind through a lifestyle with plenty of leisure, no morning alarm, and lots of long walks. This sounds ridiculous to the modern world that lives fast-paced and distracted lives.</p>

                <p>This dichotomy is the epitome of signal vs noise. You have one person who lives a very relaxed and non-distracted life vs people who run around, viscously opposed to relaxation or presence. Taleb prioritizes his mental state for important moments or decisions. He spends most of his time in a sort of idle preparation, waiting for an idea or opportunity to hit, then is able to make the most of those times.</p>

                <p>This will sound crazy to most and they would probably not believe a life like this is possible. That's a whole different argument for a different day. A calm, peaceful mind is the best asset in today's world, and cultivating one is a number one priority.</p>

                <h3>The New Landscape</h3>

                <p>A sharp mind that sees through noise can make clear decisions in split seconds, solve problems others don't have capacity to handle, and create things others don't see. The world moving forward is less about hard work and hours logged. It's more about quality of thoughts, ideas, and decisions.</p>

                <p>If your mind is free from noise you can access signal. If you have this, you're already in rare company as the majority of the world is too distracted. In today's world you can leverage ideas further than ever using the internet. This has never been possible before and is largely the reason why the middle-class work ethic is still such a sought-after character trait.</p>

                <p>The landscape has dramatically changed in the last 20 years. The world your parents grew up in is gone. The world we were prepared for doesn't exist. Blindly working hard is no longer the way forward. A sharp, clear mind is your most valuable asset today and one that is harder to have than you can imagine.</p>

                <p>Ironically, cultivating a mind like this does take work ethic. My thesis here isn't anti-work ethic - it's more that work ethic is an oversimplification and not the most important skill to have. Anyone saying life is all hard work is currently drowning in noise.</p>

                <h3>The Future Belongs to Clear Minds</h3>

                <p>The future caters to those with clear minds tapped into creativity. If you can preserve your innate creativity into adulthood and use technology as an extension of your mind, you have no ceiling.</p>

                <p>The number one tool is your mind. If it is clear, sharp, and not distracted by noise, you are above the rest.</p>

                <p>The other tools are content and code. The internet is a tool.</p>

                <p>Humans make tools. It's what we do. It's why we're here. Study human history and it will become evident.</p>

                <p>Your success as a human today depends on your ability to combine a clear mind with creativity and the technology we have available.</p>

                <p>Man has been slowly merging with machine since the day we made stone tools. Be grateful you're alive now. It's never been better despite what it looks like.</p>
