                <p>I've been working on a short documentary about a bike park being built near the town I grew up in. The process to make the video has been long and arduous. The story is quite dynamic and involves much more than just bicycles and building jumps. In creating and telling the story, I've been tinkering with some new techniques - I'm calling this one quantum thought as of now.</p>

                <p>I will be giving examples from this specific situation, however this technique could apply to really anything.</p>

                <p>The beauty of being a human is that you view the world in your own way. You're not expected to view the world like other people - humans are actually quite bad at viewing the world from others' perspectives. We are very good at viewing the world from our own perspective, though in this case, my perspective on the bike park being built and everything surrounding it is quite clear in my mind. I have lived this story because I grew up as a kid in the area with nowhere to ride. Embarking on this journey to tell the story of the park being built, I've realized that I am only telling it from my perspective.</p>

                <p>I realize that I wanted this short documentary to make sense to anybody. I'm of course targeting a specific audience, however anybody should be able to click on this video and be intrigued by the story. The problem is that, as I alluded, we are very bad at thinking like other people. How do I get in the mind of a mom or a grandfather or somebody who has never even jumped a bicycle before?</p>

                <p>Not only that, but how do I do this while still telling the story I want to tell?</p>

                <h3>The Concept of Quantum Thinking</h3>

                <p>I've heard of this concept of quantum thinking before - it involves understanding that you have a viewpoint of the world, being clear on what it is, and attempting to view what the opposing side would think themselves.</p>

                <p>This is easier said than done, and I would say almost impossible, yet the pursuit of trying to do so is valuable in my opinion.</p>

                <p>In any art form, your task is not to try to get in the mind of another person. It is to get inside of your own mind and express what you were thinking. I would say that being able to access this quantum thinking in addition to your own perspective allows you to tell a better story, or really do anything for that matter.</p>

                <p>Again, we are very bad at thinking like others. We are very good at thinking like ourselves. AI allows us to access this quantum thinking like never before. This is what I've been doing to try to make my story better.</p>

                <h3>AI as a Window Into Other Minds</h3>

                <p>I've been asking my AI large language model questions that force it to think like somebody else. Most people are using AI as a type of search engine or an extension of their own minds. I think it's much more interesting to use it in different ways - this one specifically to get inside the mind of other people. Again, that would've never been possible before AI. I would've had to bring in several other people into the editing process to try and accomplish this. Now I can do so all on my own with some clever prompts.</p>

                <p>My goal was to make my story interesting to any person that clicked on the video. I want somebody's mom to be able to watch the entire video. I want somebody's grandfather. I want somebody who's never ridden a bike to be able to watch this video and feel something. Because I've been so entrenched in this story my entire life, my perspective on it is inside of a small window. AI allows me to think like this and allows me to think on a higher plane.</p>

                <p>When you get into a project, you lose your perspective because you become too close to the subject. Prompting AI in this way allows you to zoom out again and regain your initial vision.</p>

                <p>This technique could be used across really anything. I'm finding it the most helpful process of making this short. I'm able to access multiple ways of thinking just based off of text prompts.</p>

                <h3>Everything is an Angle</h3>

                <p>Everything is an angle. I'm viewing the story from my own angle, somebody else is viewing it from a different angle. This goes much deeper than just using AI to think differently. This could be as simple as changing your scenery that you work in. Working from home versus working in a coffee shop, for instance, changes the whole energy of what you're doing - it gives you a different angle. Everything is an angle.</p>

                <p>This has just been something I've been experimenting with during this project. I wouldn't even say I fully achieved it yet. This is something I'm going to continue to tinker with over time. I would say that it has made my current video project much better than it would've been otherwise. My goal is to make it interesting to anybody, even if they've never ridden a bicycle in their life. We will see if that pans out.</p>

                <p>In my own life, my brain is fundamentally different and thinks in different ways, depending on environment. I spend a great deal of time cultivating that environment for my own personal creativity. I use things like walks, mountain bike rides, driving, the ocean, or just closing my eyes and thinking as a type of muse for ideas. This technique of quantum thinking adds another layer on top of those things. What I just said allows me to find a different angle on my own thinking. Having AI think like other people adds a new angle that was never possible before.</p>

                <p>Again, everything is just an angle. I wake up in the morning and my brain is thinking in a certain way. I go for a walk shortly after and my brain thinks in a slightly different way. After I work on something and eat lunch, my brain thinks in another different way - much less clear and productive. When I doze off to bed, my brain again starts to have an influx of ideas. These are all angles. Everything is an angle.</p>

                <h3>The Natural Flow of Ideas</h3>

                <p>Kind of a sidenote, but when people say they're gonna sit down and brainstorm something, what they're actually doing is trying to put their mind in a state to solve a problem or come up with an idea. They're trying to force their mind into finding an angle.</p>

                <p>I never force my mind into thinking a certain way - that's not how ideas come to you. I just do things that I know, based on experimentation and data, that put my mind into a certain frame of thought. Once I am in that place, the ideas just come. What I'm really doing is changing my zone, allowing what I see to be different, not vice versa.</p>

                <p>I change something in my physical environment first. This results in a change of my mental environment and this gives me a new angle on something, or even a new idea I was unaware would be created.</p>

                <p>For example, I'm writing a lot of this on a bike ride right now. My mind has been overwhelmed with all of the video work. I've been needing to make another YouTube video and unintentionally going on this bike ride allowed my mind a new angle and it naturally came up with ideas on everything I'm speaking of.</p>

                <h3>The Magic of AI Perspective</h3>

                <p>The magic of AI is not in using it to think like yourself - it's using it to think like other people.</p>

                <p>I don't know what it's like to be another person. The machines do because they have all of the data. If you want to know what some other type of person is thinking, ask AI.</p>

                <p>I find AI most helpful to think like others. It's the one thing I can't really do on my own. What I can do is prompt it in certain ways to think like others, and this allows me to broaden my perspective on a particular subject. In this specific use case of a story about a bike park being built, I can use this prompting technique to broaden my understanding of people's perspectives on the topic. Pick any subject - this way of using AI can allow you to broaden your horizon on anything if your goal is to have a more broad and complete understanding of something. This may be the best way to go about it.</p>

                <p>I know what my own perspective is. I know the story I want to tell. I know the feeling I want to convey, but how do I convey that to everyone? By understanding what different people's perspective on the subject would be, I can better convey my message to more people.</p>

                <h3>Beyond the Small Window</h3>

                <p>In a nutshell, my whole entire point here is that humans are very bad at thinking like another person. We are very good at thinking from our own perspective. Most people are using AI as an extension of their own worldview. I find it more interesting to use AI in ways my human mind is not very good at. I find it more interesting to use AI to think like others, instead of myself. This helps me attain a broader and more complete understanding of certain things.</p>

                <p>We view the world through a very small window. That window is our own perspective. It is an angle and it is very hard to get outside of this perspective. With a simple AI prompt on a specific subject, you can easily transport outside of your own perspective and into another. This has never been possible before.</p>

                <p>In a more practical sense, I could get feedback from specific people on my video project. I could have different types of people watch it and give me their thoughts. The issue is that the feedback they would give me may not even be helpful. It may confuse me more. The feedback you can get from AI is much more comprehensive. It seems to work best at taking scattered ideas and simplifying them into something much more digestible. I could ask it to view my video as if it were a 45-year-old mother and it could give me all of the data I would ever need on that. It could give me a concise perspective on what that type of person would think of my project. Seeing that way of thinking allows me to understand what I'm doing on a deeper level.</p>

                <h3>Deepening Understanding, Not Compromising Vision</h3>

                <p>It isn't about trying to fit my idea into a mold. It's about trying to understand my idea as deeply as I can, and allowing myself to see all of the other perspectives that are possible on the idea will give me a much deeper understanding of it and allow the idea to become the best thing it can be.</p>

                <p>I want to reiterate, the intention of this is not to fit the idea or the work I'm doing into a mold. I don't want to sacrifice my vision to cater to certain people. What I'm actually trying to do here is broaden my understanding of my own idea. I'm giving myself access to all kinds of different perspectives. This gives me more clarity on my project than you could even imagine. I can view my work from a different angle. I can get inside the mind of all kinds of different people and view my work from that perspective. Seeing it from all these different angles allows me to understand it on a deeper level, and it allows the idea to become the best thing it can be.</p>

                <p>When I'm working on a project like this, I get so close to it that I almost lose myself. This is just part of the creative process. You embark on a journey into the unknown and somewhere along the way you are bound to get lost if you're doing something difficult enough. Being able to come back to your beginner's mind is incredibly helpful.</p>
