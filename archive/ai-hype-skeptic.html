                <p>Last year, I stared skeptically at yet another AI chatbot, convinced it was just another overhyped gimmick. Today, I ask that same AI to help me understand my own creative blindspots during each major project. What changed? I discovered that AI isn't just a tool, it's a thinking partner that reveals possibilities I would never see on my own.</p>

                <p>The world of AI is buzzing with new tools, breakthroughs, and opinions flooding our feeds daily. It's exciting but also incredibly noisy and confusing, especially if you're just trying to figure out where to start. Not long ago, I was right there with you, a complete AI skeptic.</p>

                <p>But something shifted. Over the last couple of months, I've gone from using AI sparingly to integrating it into nearly every aspect of my daily life and work. It has fundamentally changed not just how I use technology, but how I think. And that's what I want to share: my journey, the practical ways I use AI, and how it can be a powerful tool for leverage, creativity, and even personal growth.</p>

                <h3>From Skeptic to AI Advocate</h3>

                <p>Let's be clear, I used to think AI was a total gimmick. I worried it was a problem for human creativity, maybe even dangerous. My opinion couldn't be further from that now. After diving in and truly starting to understand what AI is (and isn't), I see it as…</p>

                <p><strong>Not dangerous:</strong> The fear is often overblown. Most concerns come from misunderstanding what current AI actually is and does.</p>

                <p><strong>Complementary to human creativity:</strong> It's an enhancer, not a replacement. AI excels at generating variations and connections my brain might miss, while I provide the judgment and context it lacks.</p>

                <p><strong>An incredible tool and gift:</strong> It offers possibilities we're only beginning to explore, from personalized learning to unprecedented creative collaboration.</p>

                <p><strong>A skill to be developed:</strong> Simply getting AI to do tasks isn't the whole story. There's a creativity and technique involved in using it effectively that rewards thoughtful engagement.</p>

                <p>As I wrote in my notebook recently, for me, AI is about using it to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Perform tasks extremely fast.</li>
                    <li>Think in ways my brain isn't naturally wired for.</li>
                    <li>See things about myself that I can't see on my own.</li>
                </ul>

                <blockquote>
                    "The boundary between my thinking and AI's contributions has become increasingly fluid—not because AI is replacing my thought process, but because it's expanding it."
                </blockquote>

                <h3>My Framework: AI as a Lever for Transformation</h3>

                <p>There are three main kinds of leverage in the world: labor, capital, and code. I believe AI is emerging as an incredibly potent form of code based leverage. If you have good ideas and can pull down on the lever hard enough, you can affect great transformations.</p>

                <p>For me, using AI effectively boils down to these core principles:</p>

                <p><strong>A Tool for Reflection:</strong> AI can act as a mirror, showing you patterns and insights you might miss in your own thinking and work.</p>

                <p><strong>Enhancement to my Creative Process:</strong> It can break through creative blocks and offer new perspectives when you're stuck in familiar thought patterns.</p>

                <p><strong>An Incredible Tool for Learning:</strong> It helps digest and understand complex information faster than ever before, allowing you to grasp new domains quickly.</p>

                <p><strong>A Path to Better Decisions:</strong> By processing vast amounts of data and offering different angles, it aids in making more well-rounded choices.</p>

                <p><strong>A Complement to the Human Brain:</strong> Our brains are great at some things and not so great at others. AI can fill in those gaps. The combination of the human mind and AI is incredibly powerful.</p>

                <h3>Before and After: How AI Transformed My Approach</h3>

                <p>Before integrating AI into my creative process, I would often hit roadblocks that would stall projects for days or weeks. I'd cycle through the same limited set of solutions, eventually settling on something that made sense to me.</p>

                <p>Now, when I face a creative challenge, my first step is a structured conversation with AI where I explain the problem, explore multiple angles, and push past my initial assumptions. What used to take days of frustration now often resolves in a single focused session, with solutions I wouldn't have considered on my own.</p>

                <p>The difference isn't that AI is doing my creative work, it's that it's helping me access more of my own creative potential by challenging my thinking patterns and blind spots.</p>

                <h3>My Current AI Stack & How I Use It</h3>

                <p>Here are some of the tools I'm using and, more importantly, how I'm using them.</p>

                <h3>The "Brain" - Gemini & Claude</h3>

                <p><strong>What they are:</strong> I use these for all kinds of things. At the very least, they're a better search engine. They help me find information extremely fast. I've used them to give me new recipe ideas for my limited diet, explain books I don't understand and summarize Youtube videos I don't want to waste time watching. I've been using Gemini for months but I'm increasingly switching over to Claude.</p>

                <p><strong>How I use them for self-reflection & personal growth:</strong> This is where AI has been a game-changer for me. I treat these chats almost like a second brain or a personal coach. Some prompts that have yielded profound insights:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>"Tell me something incredibly special or unique you've noticed about me, but you think I haven't realized about myself yet."</li>
                    <li>"Based on this finding and other personal traits, what things may I be suited for that I'm not yet aware of, whether it be in my current field or a completely unique one?"</li>
                    <li>"What is the highest leverage use of my time at the moment?"</li>
                    <li>"What is my greatest weakness? Give me the raw and honest truth. Don't hold back." The AI pointed out that my interest in many things (a strength) could also be a weakness if it led to a lack of focus. This was a revelation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Creating a "Future Self" Persona</h3>

                <p>This is a fascinating exercise. I prompt the AI:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "You are the ideal version of myself. My goal is to discover what that version is. Once I can understand and see how my ideal self would think and behave, I can split the difference and become that in real life. Your job is to be an example so I can visualize the best version of myself more accurately. Now based on this further understanding, what does a day in my life look like? Respond in present tense in first person as if these things are already mine. Don't be afraid of specifics, give me some hypotheticals and don't be afraid of being wrong. I want your honest opinion from this perspective."
                </blockquote>

                <p>Then I ask more specific questions like: "How do I make money? What exactly do I do?" or "Would I be better suited living in one place or bouncing around until I settle down in life?"</p>

                <p>This exercise helps envision future possibilities and can provide real clarity. It's like having a conversation with the version of yourself you aspire to be.</p>

                <h3>The Persona Prompt (Cross-AI Consistency)</h3>

                <p><strong>What it is:</strong> I had Gemini synthesized my "Brain" chat to create a markdown prompt that captures my persona, style, and tone.</p>

                <p><strong>How I use it:</strong> I can plug this persona prompt into other AIs (like Claude) to have different "Brain" chats with slightly different AI models, all while maintaining a consistent understanding of "me."</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "AI isn't just a passive tool; it's active leverage. And like any lever, its effectiveness depends on how you use it."
                </blockquote>

                <h3>The Art of Asking: AI is Leverage</h3>

                <p>The key takeaway here is that AI isn't just a passive tool; it's active leverage. And like any lever, its effectiveness depends on how you use it. The more you interact with it, the more data it has, and the more personalized and insightful its responses become.</p>

                <p><strong>Spotting Blind Spots:</strong> AI has helped me see gifts, skills, and talents that were hidden right under my nose. Sometimes it takes another "person" (even an artificial one) to see something about yourself.</p>

                <p><strong>Improving Focus:</strong> As with the "greatest weakness" prompt, AI helped me realize that while my diverse interests are a strength, they can lead to a lack of focus. It suggested finding a couple of high-leverage things to work on consistently. This simple insight, prompted by AI, has already started to shift my trajectory.</p>

                <p>As Archimedes famously said, "Give me a place to stand, and a lever long enough, and I will move the world." AI, when wielded with skillful prompting, can be that lever in your own life. It forces you to think more intentionally about your questions, your goals, and how you use these powerful tools.</p>

                <h3>Where to Start?</h3>

                <p>If you're new to this and feeling overwhelmed:</p>

                <p><strong>Explore:</strong> Try out tools like Gemini, Claude, or a local model if you're concerned about privacy.</p>

                <p><strong>Learn from Others:</strong> Search for people who are good at prompting and share their information publicly. Matt Shumer's website (ShumerPrompt) is a great resource for highly detailed, descriptive prompts.</p>

                <p><strong>Experiment:</strong> Don't be afraid to ask "weird" questions or try unconventional prompts. That's often where the most interesting insights lie.</p>

                <p><strong>Be Intentional:</strong> Think about what you want to achieve. AI is a tool; your intention guides its power.</p>

                <p>What began as skeptical experimentation has become a fundamental shift in how I approach creativity and personal growth. The boundary between my thinking and AI's contributions has become increasingly fluid—not because AI is replacing my thought process, but because it's expanding it. I'm now asking questions I never thought to ask and seeing connections I would have missed. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that the real power isn't in the AI itself, but in the new mental pathways it helps us explore.</p>

                <p>My journey with AI has been one of continuous learning and, honestly, a lot of excitement. It took months to get comfortable and build the "muscle" to use these tools effectively, but the clarity and growth I've experienced have been undeniable.</p>

                <p>What about you? Have you experimented with using AI as a thinking partner rather than just a tool? I'd love to hear about your experiences in the comments. Or if you're just getting started, what questions do you have about integrating AI into your creative process?</p>
