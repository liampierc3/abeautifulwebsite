            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Everyone talks about creative blocks like they're some mystical force that descends upon artists without warning. Like we're helpless victims of our own minds.</p>
                
                <p>I call bullshit.</p>
                
                <h3>The myth of inspiration</h3>
                
                <p>Here's what I've learned after years of making videos: creativity isn't about waiting for lightning to strike. It's about showing up every day, even when—especially when—you don't feel like it.</p>
                
                <p>The best work I've ever done came from the days I felt least inspired. The days when I had to drag myself to the editing suite, when every cut felt wrong, when I questioned why I was doing this at all.</p>
                
                <h3>Resistance is the compass</h3>
                
                <p>Steven Pressfield was right about resistance. The more resistance you feel toward a project, the more important it probably is. That documentary I've been avoiding? The one that makes my stomach turn when I think about it? That's exactly the one I need to make.</p>
                
                <p>Creative blocks aren't blocks at all. They're signposts pointing toward the work that matters most.</p>
                
                <h3>The practice</h3>
                
                <p>So here's my practice: I show up. Every day. Even if it's just for ten minutes. Even if I delete everything I create. The act of showing up is the work.</p>
                
                <p>The muse is a myth. The work is real.</p>
